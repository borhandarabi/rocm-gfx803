# PyTorch built from source for gfx803. No gfx803 wheel has ever been published
# on any ROCm line, so there is only the from-source path.
#
# It starts from migraphx because torch needs the gfx803 rocBLAS, MIOpen and
# rocSOLVER, and that target's /opt/rocm is the one that carries all of them.
#
# Named "builder": torchvision and torchaudio build on top of this stage's full
# tree (the compiled /opt/rocm, the venv, the /pytorch checkout), so it stays the
# image docker-bake.hcl's "pytorch" target publishes. The "wheels" stage below is
# a second, separate target for a second, much smaller published image -- see the
# comment there for why that split exists.

# The final image only ever takes /wheels/*.whl from this component (see
# final.Dockerfile). Everything else in the stage above -- the full ROCm SDK,
# apt build tools, the /pytorch checkout with submodules, the compiled build
# tree -- exists only so this wheel could get built, and every one of those
# bytes still had to be pulled and unpacked by any consumer of the "pytorch"
# tag, final included, even though it reads a single small directory. A build
# that pulls this trimmed "wheels" image instead pays for the wheel and
# nothing else. docker-bake.hcl publishes this stage under its own,
# separate tag; the "pytorch" tag above still publishes the full "builder"
# stage, because torchvision and torchaudio build against that one.
